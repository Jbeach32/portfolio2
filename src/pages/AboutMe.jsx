      <img src="your-avatar-image.jpg" alt="Your Name" />
      <p>I am new to the Web Development world and excited and eager to learn. I truly enjoy a new challenge and am quick to learn new concepts and material. 
            My background in Quality Control lends itself in tying together the need for attention to detail and debugging code. 
            I was born and raised in Colorado Springs, CO and love to spend my time outdoors as often as I can. I have been married for 13 years to my wonderful wife Alyssa and we share
            the privilege of raising three wonderful children, Jackson, Jameson, and Dejah. 
            I also enjoy volunteering at my church and telling others about Jesus</p>
